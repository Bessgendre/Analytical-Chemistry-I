## An Calculation Method Modified by Symbolic Computation in Analytical Chemistry

# Abstract
The $\text{PH}$calculation of amphoteric substances $\text{NaHA}$solution is an important content of analytical chemistry. A variety of $\text{PH}$approximate formulas are introduced in the textbook, but the applicable conditions of each formula were once lacking in detailed argument, and are still under debate at present. With the aid of $\text{Mathematica}$symbol calculation software, this paper develops the analytical chemistry de-formulaic calculation method. Aiming at the selection of PH calculation formula of $\text{NaHA}$, which has been a headache in the academic circle, the author uses mathematical analysis method and visualization method to deeply reveal the feasible domain space of each formula, and tries to completely remove the obstacles for teachers and students of analytical chemistry.
